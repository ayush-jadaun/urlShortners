# Repo URL Shortener

This project is an ongoing initiative to create URL shorteners in multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Rust. Each implementation will include both a server-side service for shortening URLs and a client-side application built with React (web) and React Native (mobile). The goal is to provide a comprehensive comparison of different languages and frameworks while ensuring optimal performance and usability.

## Features (Planned)

- **Multi-Language Support:** Implement URL shorteners in JS, TS, Java, and Rust.
- **RESTful API:** Standardized API across all implementations.
- **Database Integration:** Store original and shortened URLs.
- **Custom Aliases:** Allow users to define custom short URLs.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Track usage metrics (clicks, referrers, etc.).
- **React Frontend:** Web app for shortening and managing URLs.
- **React Native App:** Mobile app for on-the-go URL shortening.
- **Performance Comparison:** Benchmark different implementations.
